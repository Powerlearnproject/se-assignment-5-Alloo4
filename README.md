2. First-time Setup:
   - After installing VS Code, what initial configurations and settings should be adjusted for an optimal coding environment? Mention any important settings or extensions.
Live Server: Provides live preview of your webpages in the browser.
ESLint: Linter for identifying JavaScript errors and code style issues.
Prettier: Code formatter to maintain consistent code style.
Debugger for Chrome/Firefox: Enables debugging web applications within VS Code.
3. User Interface Overview:
   - Explain the main components of the VS Code user interface. Identify and describe the purpose of the Activity Bar, Side Bar, Editor Group, and Status Bar.
Activity Bar (leftmost panel): Provides quick access to different VS Code features like the integrated terminal, version control (Git), and extensions.
Side Bar (second panel from the left): Contains the Explorer for managing files and folders in your project, a Search bar, and a Debug panel (when debugging is active).
Editor Group (center area): This is the main workspace where you write and edit code. You can have multiple editors open simultaneously in tabs.
Status Bar (bottom panel): Displays information about the current file, language mode, indentation, and other relevant details.
4. Command Palette:
   - What is the Command Palette in VS Code, and how can it be accessed? Provide examples of common tasks that can be performed using the Command Palette.
The Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS)  is a powerful tool for quickly finding and executing various VS Code commands. It allows you to search for specific actions without navigating through menus. Examples of tasks you can perform using the Command Palette include:

Open a specific file
Create a new file or folder
Start debugging
Search for settings
Install extensions
5. Extensions in VS Code:
   - Discuss the role of extensions in VS Code. How can users find, install, and manage extensions? Provide examples of essential extensions for web development.
Extensions are add-ons that extend VS Code's functionality for specific programming languages, frameworks, and tasks. They can add features like syntax highlighting, code completion, linters, debuggers, and more.
6. Integrated Terminal:
   - Describe how to open and use the integrated terminal in VS Code. What are the advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal?
Open the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS).
Browse the Extension Marketplace or search for specific extensions by name.
Click on an extension to view its details and reviews.
Click the "Install" button to install the extension.
You can manage installed extensions from the Extensions view (enabled/disabled/reinstalled/uninstalled).
7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
Creating, Opening, and Managing Files/Folders:

New File/Folder: Right-click in the Explorer or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or **Cmd+Shift+P
8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.
Open the Settings editor: Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS). Alternatively, use the shortcut Ctrl+
9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
Setting Up and Starting Debugging:

Enable Debugging: Make sure your programming language has debugging support enabled in VS Code extensions or settings.
Set Breakpoints: Place breakpoints in your code at lines where you want execution to pause. Click on the line number next to the code you want to debug. A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint.
Start Debugging: Go to the Run and Debug view (Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS). Choose the "Start Debugging" option (might vary based on your programming language).
Step Through Code: Once the program hits a breakpoint, the code execution pauses. You can use controls in the Debug view to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and examine the call stack.
10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
